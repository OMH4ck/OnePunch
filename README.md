# OnePunch

`OnePunch` is a tool for finding gadgets to achieve arbitrary code execution (call arbitrary function with controlled arguments).

This tool assumes you can already control the rip and some registers (And some fully controlled buffer with known addresses). 
Given a list of registers that you control, a list of registers that you want to control and a binary file, `OnePunch` will find a gadget chain in the binary that will allow you to control the target registers and the RIP.

For example, if you have control the `r8`, which you can set its value to the address of some buffer you fully control, and you want to control `rdi` because you want to call `system("sh")`, you can use `OnePunch` to make your life easier:
```bash
./build/OnePunch -i r8 -c rdi:1  -f /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 

Result:
  167f47:       mov  rax, QWORD PTR [r8+0x38]
  167f4b:       mov  rdi, r8
  167f4e:       call  QWORD PTR [rax+0x20]
------
  174fc4:       mov  rdi, QWORD PTR [rdi+0x8]
  174fc8:       push  0x0
  174fca:       lea  rcx, [rsi+0x3a0]
  174fd1:       push  0x2
  174fd3:       call  QWORD PTR [rax+0x340]
------
```

The number on the left is the offset of the gadget, the number of the right is the corresponding instructions.

Currently `OnePunch` only supports `x86_64` architecture.

## Build
```bash
cmake -Sstandalone -Bbuild
cmake --build build -j4
./build/OnePunch
```

## Usage
```bash
./build/OnePunch -h

Usage: OnePunch [-h] --input VAR... --control VAR... --file VAR [--level VAR]

Optional arguments:
  -h, --help    shows help message and exits 
  -v, --version prints version information and exits 
  -i, --input   The registers that we control [nargs: 1 or more] [required]
  -c, --control The registers we want to control [nargs: 1 or more] [required]
  -f, --file    The binary file that we want to analyze [required]
  -l, --level   The search level [default: 1]
Example: ./OnePunch -i rdi rsi -c rsp:0 rbp:1 -f libc.so.6
1 means we want to completely control the value of the register, and 0 means we allow the register to be a pointer value as long as it can point to a buffer that we control.
```

`OnePunch` will give you a random result from all possible solutions. If that gadget happens to be not working, you can just run `OnePunch` again and it is likely that you will get a different result.

## TODO
- [ ] Support specifying the range of input registers
- [ ] Support specifying the range of output registers
- [ ] Suppprt printing how to set up the memory
- [ ] Support analyzing multiple binaries

One of the important features missing is to print out how we can set up the memory. The feature is still buggy so we disable it for now. (If you really want to use it, you can uncomment the `record_memory` in `src/onepunch.cpp`).

## Note
The code is messy right now.
